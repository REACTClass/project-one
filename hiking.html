        Sólheimajökull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Mýrdalsjökull and is surrounded by some of Iceland's most
        grand volcanoes and during summertime, a glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier only adding to the charm
        of the location. This popular day tour is the perfect way to get in real contact with the true behind the name
        Ice-land!
