        The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antartica. Luckily, there are much more accessible
        places if you'd like to take these light shows yourself. For the best seats to this celestial scene, consider
        anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55&deg; and low light pollution. Find your magnetic latitude on NOAA
        and here.

        In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights are good but not necessarily
        the best time. Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth's magnetic field let more solar particles
        interact with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox in September, when there are
        pleasant temperatures in polar latitudes. Find the dark hours of your locatioon here, or by using sky guide app.
