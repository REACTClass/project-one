<h1>Iceland</h1>

<p><b><i>Iceland</i></b> is a country of sharp contrast. A place where fire and ice co-exist. Where dark winters are
    offset by
    the summer's midnight sun. A country where insular existence has spured a rich and vibrant culture.</p>

        The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north
        wind, Boreas. From September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificient lightshow.
        <br>
        The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon created when
        particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy,
        causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.

        When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's manesake-namel, its
        4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glciers is paracticed year-round and takes place mainly on
        the Sólheimajökull and Svínafellsjökull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from
        Reykjavik (and Skaftafell).
